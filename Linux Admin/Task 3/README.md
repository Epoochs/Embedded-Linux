# SectionTwo's-Answer

**1.**  ```bash
        ls /usr/bin/ > /tmp/command.list
        ```
        <br />
**2.** by editing in /etc/motd file which stands for (Message of The Day) using nano editor <br />
        ```bash
        nano /etc/motd
        ```
        <br />
        this will open a window, then you can write whatever you want to display as a message when you log into a new session. Then you save using (^x -> y).
        <br />
        and we can change the prompt permenantly by modifying the .bashrc file (which is a script used to configure the shell enviroment settings for the bash shell) using also nano editor:
        <br />
        ```bash
        nano ~/.bashrc
        ```
        <br />
        This will open the file and we change PS1 that is used to set the prompt.
        <br />
        ```bash
        PS1='[\u@\h \W \d]\$ '
        ```
        <br />
        then applying the changes by sourcing the .bashrc
        <br />
        ```bash
        source ~/.bashrc
        ```

**3.** The command used to count the word in a file is `wc` which stands for **Word Count** 
        <br />
        ```bash
        wc -w filename.txt
        # -w: used to as an option to count the words
        ```
        <br />
        To count the number of commands using `wc`:
        <br />
        ```bash
        wc -l /tmp/command.list
        # -l: stands for `line` which means the number of lines.
        ```
        <br />

**4.** - ```bash
         cat filename1 | cat filename2
         ```
         <br />
         This will print only the content of the file 2 and the output of file one will be ignored.
         <br />
       - ```bash
        ls | rm
         ```
         <br />
         This should delete the contents in the current directory, but this is not the case becase `rm` is taking the name of files as arguments not as standard input.
         <br />
       - ```bash
         ls /etc/passwd | wc â€“l
         ```
         This will generate an error as `passwd` is neither a file nor a directory.his counts the number of lines in the output of ls /etc/passwd. Since ls /etc/passwd produces a single line containing the file name passwd, wc -l will count this as one line.
         <br />


**5.** ```bash sudo find / -type f -name ".profile" ```

**6.** ```bash ls -id /etc/hosts ```
**7.** ```bash sudo ln -s /etc/passwd /boot/passwd ```
**8.** Creating a hard link of /etc/passwd in /boot would generally not be feasible or advisable for several reasons. Some of them are:
            - Hard links cannot be created for directories (with a few exceptions in certain situations), but they can be created for files.
            - Hard links must reside on the same file system as the original file. This means you cannot create a hard link to /etc/passwd in /boot if /boot and /etc are on different file systems.

**9.** >: It indicates that the shell is expecting more input to complete the command you started. This usually happens when the shell detects that the command is incomplete or that additional input is required.
          <br />
          ```bash
            echo \
          ```
          <br />
          we can change it from `>` to `:` by modifying the PS2 in the `.bashrc`; PS2 is an environment variable used in Unix-like operating systems' command shells, such as bash. It defines the secondary prompt string, which is displayed when a command spans multiple lines or when the shell expects additional input from the user.
          <br />
          ```bash
          PS2=':'
          ```
